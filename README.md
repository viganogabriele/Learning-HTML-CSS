# Web Development Learning Lab 🚀

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my projects and exercises as I study **Front-End Development**.

## 📌 About this Repo
I created this space to document my progress, test new concepts, and practice modern web standards. Each folder represents a specific challenge or a learning milestone where I focus on:
- **Semantic HTML5**: Writing clean, accessible, and meaningful markup.
- **Modern CSS3**: Mastering Flexbox, Grid, and responsive design patterns.
- **Best Practices**: Learning industry-standard naming conventions and clean code architecture.
- **Git Workflow**: Improving my version control skills through meaningful and atomic commits.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Editor**: VS Code (Linux) with Emmet for efficient scaffolding.
- **Styles**: Custom CSS, Google Fonts, and specialized typography techniques.
- **Architecture**: Experimenting with BEM-inspired naming and modular styles.

## 📈 My Learning Journey
I am currently transitioning from "making things work" to "making things work the right way." This includes:
- Moving away from redundant margins in favor of **Flexbox**.
- Choosing semantic class names over purely visual ones.
- Documenting my logic to ensure scalability and readability.

*This is a living repository. As I learn more, I'll keep refactoring old projects and adding new ones.*
